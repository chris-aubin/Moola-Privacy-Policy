                </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
                  Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                  commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                  to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
                  stored on your device's internal memory.
                </p> <p>
                  Moola does not use these cookies explicitly. However,
                  the app may use third party code and libraries that use
                  cookies to collect information and improve their services.
                  You may either permit or refuse the use of these cookies. If you
                  choose to refuse the use of cookies, you may not be able to use some

                </p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p>
                  Moola may employ third-party companies and
                  individuals due to the following reasons:

                  Thus, we would like to inform users of Moola
                  that these third parties may have access to your personal
                  information, but only to perform tasks assigned to
                  them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
                  disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

                  of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                  storage is 100% secure and reliable, and thus Moola cannot
                  guarantee its absolute security.

                  a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
                  that these external sites are not operated by Moola.
